Morphometrics

Since its discovery, microglia has intrigued researchers with its ability to respond to external stimuli, addapting its morphology, 
migrating and accumulating at lesion sites (Del Rio-Hortega, 1932). Microglia is a highly dynamic cell involved in highly complex 
homeostatic processes (Sierra et al., 2014; Lier, J. 2020; McNamara et al., 2023). This heterogeneity gives microglia great sensitivity
to different brain microenvironments, enabling it to perform a myrriad of functions (Matejuk, 2020). Due to its responsiveness to 
microenvironments, microglia is a key player in understanding and addressing neurological diseases and central nervous system 
disorders (Li, 2018; Matejuk, 2020). Consequently, quantitative measurement of microglial morphology has been widely used in 
neuroscience (Reddaway, 2023), such as assessing neuroinflammatory states (Green, 2022).

However, despite the development of quantitative methods to measure microglial morphology, there is a lack of comparability between
methods, leading to discrepancies in the results obtained (Green, 2022; Reddaway, 2023). Moreover, for reliable inferences, a more
precise quantification of microglia is needed to capture the variability in its morphology for a more biological interpretation 
(Green, 2022; Reddaway, 2023).

Detecting subtle changes in microglial morphology throughout the spectrum would provide an early indication of its immediate responses to
local environmental signals, given its irritability to microenvironment cues (Stratoulias, 2019; Siegert, 2022). In this context, most 
analyses have been restricted in terms of the number or type of features used in their analyses. The most widely used methods for analyzing
microglial morphology are: 1) Fractal analysis; 2) Skeleton analysis; 3) Cell body area and perimeter; and 4) Sholl analysis (Green, 2022).

Furthermore, biases in effect size can occur due to the selection of cells within the chosen sample (single-cell analysis vs. full photomicrograph
analysis; Green, 2022). Reductions in effect size can occur when averaged in the dataset (Simpson's paradox). For example, 67-93% less effect size
has been reported using full photomicrograph analysis than in single-cell analysis, using the same metrics (Green, 2022). Therefore, although 
the use of full photomicrograph analysis is desirable for its fleetness, it is avoided due to its statistical consequences (Green, 2022). 
Conversely, single-cell analysis is more labor-intensive but statistically shows greater differences, making it more commonly employed (Green, 2022).

To capture the complexity of microglial morphology, it is necessary to use the fewest variables that provide the most information possible 
(Siegert, 2022). However, due to the heterogeneity of microglia and the particularity of each study, selecting features that best profile microglia
for each situation becomes a challenge. Thus, considering the high biological heterogeneity, we have developed a pipeline that, based on the 
four main methods of microglial analysis and using data analysis techniques, allows the selection of features that best profile differences between 
study groups.
